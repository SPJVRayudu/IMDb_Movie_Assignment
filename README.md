# IMDb_Movie_Assignment

 In this project, I had the data for the 100 top-rated movies 
from the past decade along with various pieces of 
information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who 
have rated these movies online. I found some interesting 
insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.
ï‚· In Exploratory Data Analysis step, found out insights like 
most famous Actors, Top 5 Films based on collections,
ratings, genres and budget, Top trios.
